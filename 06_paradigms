Racket/scheme:
(display "Hello, World!")

Netlogo:
print "Hello, World!"

Python:
print("Hello, World!")

Similarities: 
each have an output keyword/function and "Hello, World!" at the end in quotes (string).

Differences: 
Racket uses prefix notation and has parentheses around function calls
Netlogo doesn't require parentheses
Python needs parentheses after the print keyword to call.
