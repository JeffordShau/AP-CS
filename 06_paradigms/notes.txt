/*
Similarities: 
Each language contained an output keyword/function and the "Hello, World!" string at the end in quotes.

Differences: 
Racket uses prefix notation and has parentheses around function calls
Netlogo doesn't require parentheses
Python needs parentheses after the print keyword to call.
