/*
DISCO:
  0. Implemented the Math.random into my code to randomize the coin flips.
  1. "this" keyword refers to the current object in the invocation of the Driver line.
  2. Found that using Math.random was easier to use than importing random class.
QCC:
  0. How do you check if an object exists without producing an error?
  1. When is it better to import the random class than use Math.random?

/***
    driver for class Coin
    ~~~ SUGGESTED WORKFLOW: ~~~
    1. Compile this file and run. Note anything notable.
    2. Move the "TOP" line down, so that it is below the first statement.
    (emacs: with cursor at beginning of TOP line, C-k C-k, DOWN, DOWN, C-y)
    (your editor: ???)
    3. Compile and run again.
    4. Resolve errors one at a time until it works.
    5. Repeat 2-4 until TOP meets BOTTOM.
