time spent: 1 hr

DISCO:
- boolean returns is extremely useful for backtracking recursive methods
- backtracking requires a way to step forward and a way to step backward

QCC:
- how can we vary the solutions that the code can generate?

Predictions:
- 3x3 board cannot place 3 queens
- 4x4 boards and larger NxN boards can place N Queens.
